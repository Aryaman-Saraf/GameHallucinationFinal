PROJECT STATUS REPORT - HALLUCINATION
Generated on: 2026-02-01

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
-------------------
Topic: MASK
Genre: First-Person Horror Puzzle
Engine: Unreal Engine 5 (Blueprint Implementation)
Current State: Key gameplay mechanics (Mask, Visibility, Ghost) implemented.

2. IMPLEMENTED FEATURES
-----------------------

A. The Mask Mechanic (Core Gameplay)
   - Activation: Player can toggle the mask on/off (Input Action mapped, likely 'F').
   - Duration Limit: Mask stays active for 30 seconds max.
   - Cooldown: Requires 60 seconds recharge after depletion.
   - Visuals: "Hallucination" Post-Process effect triggers when mask is ON.
   - Logic Location: `BP_FirstPersonCharacter`

B. Ghost Entity
   - Logic: Ghost visibility is tied to the Mask state.
     - Mask ON -> Ghost VISIBLE
     - Mask OFF -> Ghost INVISIBLE
   - Asset: `BP_Ghost` (Located in Content/Ghost)

C. Hidden Object System (Pickups)
   - Functionality: Objects that are invisible to the naked eye but appear when wearing the mask.
   - Asset: `BP_MasterPickup` (Located in Content/Core)
   - Logic: Listens for Mask state changes to toggle mesh visibility/collision.

D. Player Character
   - Movement: Standard First-Person movement (Walk, Jump).
   - Input: Enhanced Input System used (`IMC_Default`).
   - Interaction: Handles the timer and state management for the mask.

3. KEY ASSETS & STRUCTURE
-------------------------
- Core Logic: `Content/Core`
  - `BP_FirstPersonCharacter.uasset` (Main Player Logic)
  - `BP_MasterPickup.uasset` (Hidden Items)
  - `BP_FirstPersonGameMode.uasset` (Game Rules)

- AI/Enemy: `Content/Ghost`
  - `BP_Ghost.uasset` (Ghost Logic & Visuals)

- Input: `Content/Input`
  - `IMC_Default.uasset` (Input Mapping Context)

4. PENDING / SUGGESTED NEXT STEPS (Deciphered from State)
---------------------------------------------------------
- Ghost AI Behavior: Currently verify if "Patrol" or "Chase" logic is fully implemented (BP_Ghost exists but logic needs testing).
- Trap Mechanic: README mentions "trap a ghost", but no specific "Trap" asset (like `BP_Trap`) was found in Core. This feature may need to be added.
- Level Design: `Content/Level` and `Content/Scene_Saloon` exist, suggesting a base level is present but may need expansion.
- HUD/UI: No specific UI widget (like `WBP_HUD`) was prominent in the top-level scan, likely needed for Mask Timer/Cooldown display.
