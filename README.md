> "Some things are better left unseen... until you put on the mask."

**Global Game Jam 2026 Submission**

## 📖 Description
**Hallucination** is a First-Person Horror Puzzle game built in Unreal Engine 5.

Startled by a mysterious presence in an abandoned town, you discover a strange mask that allows you to see into a "Hallucinated Reality." But curiosity comes at a cost. The mask reveals what was hidden—keys, messages, and paths—but it also reveals **THEM**.

The Ghost is invisible to the naked eye. It only exists when you wear the mask.
*Do you dare to look?*
